Things to do
============

* Create the check_out, check_err, etc. functions.

* Fix the tests broken in test-date-utils since "arg_or_input" functions were
  added.

* create a test suite for test-utils.sh: test-test-utils.sh :-)

* check for co-dependencies in all the -util.sh libraries.  Eg: mutually sourcing each other.
