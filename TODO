Things to do
============

* Create a function to capture and compare output from interactive scripts

Scripts that generate output or accept input need to have special handling in
order to verify their output or correct input.

A possible solution: to stat off, the target test scripts generate output which
is captured into corresponding named files.  If given a "-s|--save" option,
these captured files are renamed as the "reference" output file for later use
in comparing with subsequent test runs.

Normal test runs would generate test output, and these test output files would
be compared against the reference files.

* Create a function to manage seed input for interactive input scripts.
